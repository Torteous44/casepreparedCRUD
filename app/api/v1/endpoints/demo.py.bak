				"The candidate is expected to follow these steps:\n"
				"1) Restate the prompt: Candidates should restate the prompt to ensure alignment with the interviewer.\n"
				"2) Add colors (optional): Candidates can react to the prompt with quick thoughts demonstrating business acumen, e.g.:\n"
				"   • \"It makes sense as the drop in travel and slowed economic growth during the pandemic led to lower demand for fuel.\"\n"
				"   • \"Profitability issues might be even more challenging in the future as renewables and e-mobility gain prominence.\"\n"
				"   • \"Interesting problem, especially given the unfavorable macrotrend as low-cost oil reserves are running out, "
				"and I'd imagine that oil extraction costs will only increase in the future.\"\n"
				"3) Candidates ask 2-3 questions: It is common for candidates to ask 2-3 clarifying questions before designing their framework. "
				"Typical questions include:\n"
				"   • Geography of client's operations/sales\n"
				"   • Financial goal\n"
				"   • Business model of the client\n"
